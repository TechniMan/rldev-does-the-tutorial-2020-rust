# [r/roguelikedev](https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev) Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial 2020
#### Using Rust, RLTK

This is a simple project following along with [r/roguelikedev](https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev)'s weekly tutorial catch-up.

I was planning on using libtcod's C++ variant (well, the original) but linking libraries in C++ is so difficult and awkward that I gave up when I couldn't get anything to even build after 5 hours. And I already did (most of) it in Python [a few months ago](https://github.com/techniman/firstpersonroguelike), so I thought I'd do it in a different language this time. While it may not be libtcod, [the tutorials I'm following](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/) are based on that series, although also based on using an ECS; being new to Rust, I'll stick to the tutorials fairly closely for now and maybe start playing with it later on.
